* Introduction, summarize previous work
* Building of the work of my predecessor Sarah
* Checkout her blog [here](http://mmore500.com/waves/blog/prefab-tools.html)! For an overview of the great work she did!

## Goals
* Loads of ideas, new and old, for prefab components
* A number of juicy issues to try and close

#### It will be simple they said, "a button", they said
* Starting simple, just add a reload button to the config panel
* Discovering and fixing bugs in the Config panel

#### How _Card_ could it be?
* Tackling the issues when trying to override the stream operator

#### The Config Conundrum
* Discovering the bug that forced ConfigPanel to be global
* Refactoring to make it more modular

#### Live Variables in the Limelight
* Idea for a readout panel
* Fun with forwarding r-value references of variadic template
* Keeping a low footprint in mind for CSS

#### Control Panel
* Managing simulation with some standard controls
* Ideas for helpful user interfaces: ToggleButtonGroups and AugmentedButtons

## Some Takeaways
* Came across a number of ideas that could prove valuable as design principles
* Some opinions about the direction prefab component development should go

#### Modularity is King, Inheritance is Queen
* Making small components is valuable even if we don't think users will use them raw
* Building off existing components is necessary but we need a standard system
* One idea to solve this and some of its shortcomings

#### You know... there's CSS for that
* Making components less opinionated doing more with CSS

## Thoughts on the Future
* Challenges of eventually upgrade to Bootstrap v5.0
* Challenges of responsive web design
* How to make Bootstrap grid accessible
