# Warmup

> “Can You Hear Me Now?” is one of the best online team building games.
> You play this game in a virtual conference room, and nominate one person to be the speaker and the rest are artists.
> The speaker uses a random image generator to source a suitable image, and the goal is to describe that image in such a way that the artists can draw it successfully.
>
> The one guideline is the speaker must only use geometric shapes. For example, you could say “draw a large circle and then three equidistant triangles” but not “write the letter E.”
> By limiting instructions, the speaker needs to exercise extremely accurate communication skills, and the artists need to listen and interpret.

[Rankin, Yolanda A., Jakita O. Thomas, and Sheena Erete. "Real talk: saturated sites of violence in CS education." ACM Inroads 12.2 (2021): 30-37.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3408877.3432432)

Please bring something outside of the paper that helps deepen your understanding of the underlying issues the paper is discussing itself.
This could be a story in the news, a fact or statistic from a talk, a line of reasoning from another paper, a personal experience, a story from a friend, a passage from a book, a poem, a piece of art, really anything.
Aim for something you can present in a minute or two.
This is optional, but encouraged.
