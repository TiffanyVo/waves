# Pre-Discussion Learning Material

[Rankin, Yolanda A., Jakita O. Thomas, and Sheena Erete. "Real talk: saturated sites of violence in CS education." ACM Inroads 12.2 (2021): 30-37.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3408877.3432432)

Please bring something outside of the paper that helps deepen your understanding of the underlying issues the paper is discussing itself.
This could be a story in the news, a fact or statistic from a talk, a line of reasoning from another paper, a personal experience, a story from a friend, a passage from a book, a poem, a piece of art, really anything.
Aim for something you can present in a minute or two.
This is optional, but encouraged.
